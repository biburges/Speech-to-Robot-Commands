## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to take speech and convert it into text which will convert it into robot commands for a robot car.


## Contributions
This project is unique as it will allow people with upper limb disabilities to be able to use and provide commands to robot cars.


## Project Plan

### Speech-to-Text

Using Python Speech Recognition software, PyAudio, and Python pyttsx3, it will take input from a microphone and convert it into text

### LLM

Using a LLM such as OpenAi or Keyword Matching, to take the text and convert it into commands for the robot to understand

### Robot Commands

We will use ROS or Gazebo to take the robot commands and send them to the robot car.
